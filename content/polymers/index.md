## Overview

Polymers are a new addition to the `Nested Materials` array of objects and are submitted through the Builder in 3 different types:

- [With CASRN](./with-casrn)
- [Without CASRN](./without-casrn)
- [Unwilling to Share](./undisclosed)

`Polymers`, if included, exist as an array of Polymer objects listed with the key of `Polymers` and are structured based on the links above.
